        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a body element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children—in this case, the body element—is known as the parent element.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>In CSS we have several types of boxes that generally fit into the categories of block boxes and inline boxes. The type refers to how the box behaves in terms of page flow and in relation to other boxes on the page. Boxes have an inner display type and an outer display type.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>Branch: A workspace, within a repository, where you can make changes that do not affect the live site.</li>
          <li>Commit Changes: A commit happens when you are adding, editing, or deleting a file within your repository. Adds changes to your branch.</li>
          <li>Issue: A way to report new tasks or content fixes. All new issues are tracked on the project board, once created. Best practice to move issue to Done (and thereby close the issue) once it is done.</li>
          <li>Merge: When a pull request (“PR”) is approved, changes are pulled in or merged into the main branch. Changes, ultimately, move on in the process to being published/deployed to the live site, once merge happens.</li>
          <li>Pull Request (“PR”): Asking for changes on your branch to be pulled in/merged into another branch. A way of discussing and reviewing your work with others.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS:</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator "===" checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result of "true" if the values are equal and "false" if the values are not equal.</li>
